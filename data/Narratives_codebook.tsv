Political hate and polarisation (Pro far-left)	Refers to the manipulative narratives that fundamentally reject the existing socio-economic structure of contemporary capitalism. These narratives advocate for an alternative economic and power structure based on principles of economic justice and social equality. They view economic inequality as a core issue within the current political and social arrangements and propose a major redistribution of resources from existing political elites. Additionally, they support a state role in controlling the economy. These narratives target both “radical left” who accepts democracy but favors “workers’ democracy” and the direct participation of labor in the management of the economy, and the “extreme left” emphasizes both parliamentary, as well as the extra-parliamentary struggle against globalized capitalism, and sees no place for free-market enterprise.

Political hate and polarisation (Anti-woke)	Narratives that frame efforts to address social inequalities—such as racism, sexism, and anti-LGBTQ+ discrimination—as exaggerated, illegitimate, or a threat to societal norms.
